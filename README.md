# Monopoly-Simulator
Project to find the most landed on squares throughout the course of a Monopoly game.
Currently simulates 100,000 games with 4 players going through 30 turns each while incorporating Chance/Community Chest cards.
The program utilizes the Matplotlib library to visualize the findings.

# Running the project
run main.py

# Example output
The graph shows the percent the square was landed on out of all rolls.The numbers may vary slightly each run due to the nature of the Monte Carlo method. Jail is by far the most landed on space. This makes sense, due to the amount of game mechanics which send you to the jail square.
